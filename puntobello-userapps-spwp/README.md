# User Apps webpart

## Summary
This web part displays a list of all available apps alongside the userâ€™s favorited apps.

![User Apps Webpart](../assets/myapps-userapps-page.png)

### Features
The user is presented with two lists of apps:

- Favorited apps selected by the user.
- All available apps within the organization.  

The user can pin or unpin apps and rearrange the list of favorited apps in a custom order. The favorited apps are then displayed through the User Apps Extension.  

This SPFx solution is to be used with the [PuntoBello User Apps Extension](../puntobello-userapps-extension/README.md).

### Parameters
You can configure all the parameters in the corresponding files located in the `env` directory. Once set, build the solution accordingly.
